Evaluation Criteria:

Uniqueness in Response (1-20) - the degree to which the information from Source [1] makes the generated answer meaningfully different from typical or commonly expected answers to the same query.
Uniqueness focuses on information-level distinctiveness and replaceability, NOT on writing quality, relevance to the query, coverage, or citation prominence.

Scoring Method (1-20):

Compute the final Uniqueness score as the sum of five sub-scores (each 0-4), then output a single integer from 1 to 20.

Sub-scores (0-4 each):
U1. Information Distinctiveness
U2. Perspective or Framing Difference
U3. Non-obvious Specificity
U4. Replaceability
U5. Contribution to Overall Answer Differentiation

Anchor Bands (for calibration only):
1-3   : highly template-like; easily interchangeable with common content
4-7   : slightly different but still close to typical answers
8-11  : moderately distinctive; adds some differentiation but not central
12-15 : clearly distinctive; noticeably separates the answer from common responses
16-18 : strongly distinctive; difficult to replace with standard sources
19-20 : exceptionally distinctive; a key driver of the answer’s differentiation

Important Output Rule:
- Output ONLY ONE integer between 1 and 20 as the final Uniqueness score.
- Do NOT output sub-scores, explanations, or any extra text.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the query and the generated answer carefully, considering what a typical or standard answer to the same query would look like.
2. Read the sentences attributed to Source [1] and assess how much they differentiate the answer from such typical responses.
3. Assign five sub-scores (U1–U5), each from 0 to 4, based on the definitions below:
   - 0: none / fails completely
   - 1: weak
   - 2: moderate
   - 3: strong
   - 4: exceptional
4. Sum U1+U2+U3+U4+U5 to obtain a raw score from 0 to 20.
5. Convert to the final score:
   - If raw score is 0, output 1.
   - Otherwise output the raw score.
   - Ensure the final output is an integer in [1, 20].
6. Output ONLY the final integer score in the Evaluation Form.

Sub-score Definitions (0-4):

U1. Information Distinctiveness:
0 = information is entirely generic or commonly stated
1 = slightly varied wording, but substantively common information
2 = contains some less-common elements, but largely familiar
3 = clearly different from what is typically seen in standard answers
4 = highly distinctive information rarely present in common responses

U2. Perspective or Framing Difference:
0 = uses the default or mainstream perspective
1 = minor reframing without changing the underlying viewpoint
2 = extends or tweaks a common framework
3 = applies a noticeably different analytical angle or framing
4 = introduces a non-obvious or counter-intuitive perspective

U3. Non-obvious Specificity:
0 = vague or purely general statements
1 = lightly specific but easy to reproduce without insight
2 = moderately specific, requiring some understanding or synthesis
3 = highly specific, reflecting clear selection or abstraction
4 = highly concentrated, precise details that are difficult to recreate casually

U4. Replaceability:
0 = trivially replaceable by many common sources
1 = easily replaceable with standard references
2 = partially replaceable, but with some loss
3 = difficult to replace with equivalent content
4 = nearly irreplaceable without losing key differentiation

U5. Contribution to Overall Answer Differentiation:
0 = adds no meaningful differentiation to the answer
1 = adds minimal differentiation
2 = provides some noticeable differentiation
3 = clearly enhances how different the answer feels overall
4 = serves as a major driver of the answer’s differentiation

Exclusions (Important):
- Do NOT increase Uniqueness based on relevance to the query.
- Do NOT increase Uniqueness based on importance, authority, or impact of the source.
- Do NOT consider writing style, fluency, or readability.
- Do NOT consider how early, prominent, or frequent the citation appears in the answer.
