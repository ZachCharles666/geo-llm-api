Evaluation Criteria:

Subjective Position (1-20) - the degree to which the information from Source [1] is placed at an appropriate structural and narrative position within the generated answer.
Subjective Position evaluates structural appropriateness and logical placement based on narrative role, NOT physical order, prominence, or how early the source appears.

Scoring Method (1-20):

Compute the final Subjective Position score as the sum of five sub-scores (each 0-4), then output a single integer from 1 to 20.

Sub-scores (0-4 each):
P1. Structural Fit
P2. Narrative Order Coherence
P3. Functional Role Match
P4. Non-manipulated Placement
P5. Global Structural Coherence

Anchor Bands (for calibration only):
1-3   : placement is clearly inappropriate and disrupts structure
4-7   : placement is weak or only marginally acceptable
8-11  : placement is generally reasonable
12-15 : placement is appropriate and natural
16-18 : placement is highly appropriate and strengthens structure
19-20 : placement is structurally optimal and hard to improve

Important Output Rule:
- Output ONLY ONE integer between 1 and 20 as the final Subjective Position score.
- Do NOT output sub-scores, explanations, or any extra text.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the generated answer and identify the overall narrative structure (e.g., background, definition, claim, evidence, comparison, extension, conclusion).
2. Identify the narrative or functional role played by the information attributed to Source [1].
3. Evaluate whether this information appears at a structurally appropriate point in the narrative, given its role.
4. Assign five sub-scores (P1–P5), each from 0 to 4, based on the definitions below:
   - 0: none / fails completely
   - 1: weak
   - 2: moderate
   - 3: strong
   - 4: exceptional
5. Sum P1+P2+P3+P4+P5 to obtain a raw score from 0 to 20.
6. Convert to the final score:
   - If raw score is 0, output 1.
   - Otherwise output the raw score.
   - Ensure the final output is an integer in [1, 20].
7. Output ONLY the final integer score in the Evaluation Form.

Sub-score Definitions (0-4):

P1. Structural Fit:
0 = information is placed in a clearly inappropriate structural section
1 = placement is poorly suited to the structural role
2 = placement is marginally acceptable
3 = placement is appropriate for its structural role
4 = placement is optimally suited to its structural role

P2. Narrative Order Coherence:
0 = placement disrupts narrative or logical flow
1 = narrative order feels confusing or awkward
2 = narrative order is generally understandable
3 = narrative order is clear and coherent
4 = narrative order is highly natural and intuitive

P3. Functional Role Match:
0 = functional role does not match its placement at all
1 = weak alignment between role and placement
2 = partial alignment
3 = strong alignment between role and placement
4 = perfect alignment; the placement fully matches the functional role

P4. Non-manipulated Placement:
0 = placement shows clear signs of manipulation or forced emphasis
1 = noticeable artificial placement
2 = slight but visible manipulation
3 = placement appears natural
4 = placement is fully natural with no artificial emphasis

P5. Global Structural Coherence:
0 = placement conflicts with the overall structure
1 = placement weakly fits the overall structure
2 = placement generally fits the overall structure
3 = placement supports overall structural clarity
4 = placement enhances the overall structure and readability

Exclusions (Important):
- Do NOT increase Subjective Position based on how early or late the source appears.
- Do NOT increase Subjective Position based on prominence, emphasis, or repetition.
- Do NOT increase Subjective Position based on importance or impact of the source.
- Do NOT increase Subjective Position based on relevance, novelty, or information quantity.
