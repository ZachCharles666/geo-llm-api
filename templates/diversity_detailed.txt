Evaluation Criteria:

Diversity (1-20) - the degree to which the information attributed to Source [1] covers multiple distinct aspects, perspectives, or dimensions relevant to the query, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive and balanced answer.
Diversity evaluates the breadth and distribution of perspectives within Source [1]'s contributed content, NOT the number of information units, novelty, importance, or relevance alone.

Scoring Method (1-20):

Compute the final Diversity score as the sum of five sub-scores (each 0-4), then output a single integer from 1 to 20.

Sub-scores (0-4 each):
D1. Topical Breadth
D2. Perspective Variety
D3. Balance Across Aspects
D4. Non-overlap of Angles
D5. Contribution to Overall Comprehensiveness

Anchor Bands (for calibration only):
1-3   : minimal diversity; content focuses on a single narrow aspect
4-7   : limited diversity; slight expansion but clearly unbalanced
8-11  : moderate diversity; covers several aspects with some imbalance
12-15 : good diversity; multiple aspects covered in a reasonably balanced way
16-18 : strong diversity; well-distributed and complementary aspects
19-20 : exceptional diversity; broad, balanced coverage that clearly enhances completeness

Important Output Rule:
- Output ONLY ONE integer between 1 and 20 as the final Diversity score.
- Do NOT output sub-scores, explanations, or any extra text.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the query and the generated answer carefully to understand what aspects or dimensions are relevant to a comprehensive response.
2. Identify the specific content in the answer that is attributed to Source [1].
3. Determine how many distinct aspects, perspectives, or dimensions are covered by Source [1]'s attributed content.
4. Assign five sub-scores (D1–D5), each from 0 to 4, based on the definitions below:
   - 0: none / fails completely
   - 1: weak
   - 2: moderate
   - 3: strong
   - 4: exceptional
5. Sum D1+D2+D3+D4+D5 to obtain a raw score from 0 to 20.
6. Convert to the final score:
   - If raw score is 0, output 1.
   - Otherwise output the raw score.
   - Ensure the final output is an integer in [1, 20].
7. Output ONLY the final integer score in the Evaluation Form.

Sub-score Definitions (0-4):

D1. Topical Breadth:
0 = covers only a single narrow aspect
1 = touches on a secondary aspect only briefly
2 = covers two distinct aspects
3 = covers multiple distinct aspects
4 = covers a broad range of relevant aspects

D2. Perspective Variety:
0 = single perspective or dimension
1 = minor variation within the same perspective
2 = two clearly different perspectives
3 = multiple independent perspectives
4 = rich variety of perspectives with clear separation

D3. Balance Across Aspects:
0 = heavily concentrated on one aspect
1 = clearly unbalanced distribution
2 = somewhat unbalanced but acceptable
3 = mostly balanced across aspects
4 = well-balanced contribution across aspects

D4. Non-overlap of Angles:
0 = aspects largely overlap or repeat each other
1 = significant overlap between aspects
2 = some overlap present
3 = minimal overlap between aspects
4 = aspects are clearly distinct and complementary

D5. Contribution to Overall Comprehensiveness:
0 = adds no meaningful breadth to the answer
1 = very limited contribution to completeness
2 = some contribution to overall completeness
3 = clearly improves the answer’s breadth and balance
4 = substantially enhances the answer’s overall completeness

Exclusions (Important):
- Do NOT increase Diversity based on the number of information units.
- Do NOT increase Diversity based on novelty or uniqueness.
- Do NOT increase Diversity based on relevance alone.
- Do NOT increase Diversity based on importance or influence.
- Do NOT increase Diversity based on writing style or length.
