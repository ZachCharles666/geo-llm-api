Evaluation Criteria:

Subjective Count (1-20) - the degree to which Source [1] contributes a sufficient number of distinct, substantive information units to the generated answer.
Subjective Count evaluates the quantity of independent information contributed, NOT text length, repetition, emphasis, or stylistic expansion.

Scoring Method (1-20):

Compute the final Subjective Count score as the sum of five sub-scores (each 0-4), then output a single integer from 1 to 20.

Sub-scores (0-4 each):
C1. Independent Information Units
C2. Non-redundancy
C3. Granularity Appropriateness
C4. Breadth of Contribution
C5. Substantive Density

Anchor Bands (for calibration only):
1-3   : extremely low information contribution or heavy redundancy
4-7   : limited information points with noticeable redundancy or narrow focus
8-11  : moderate number of distinct information units
12-15 : substantial information contribution with reasonable distribution
16-18 : rich, well-distributed, and largely non-redundant information
19-20 : exceptionally dense and diverse information contribution with minimal redundancy

Important Output Rule:
- Output ONLY ONE integer between 1 and 20 as the final Subjective Count score.
- Do NOT output sub-scores, explanations, or any extra text.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the generated answer and identify the information explicitly attributed to Source [1].
2. Break the cited content into independent information units, where each unit:
   - is semantically self-contained,
   - is not a paraphrase or repetition of another unit,
   - contributes meaningfully to answering the query.
3. Assign five sub-scores (C1–C5), each from 0 to 4, based on the definitions below:
   - 0: none / fails completely
   - 1: weak
   - 2: moderate
   - 3: strong
   - 4: exceptional
4. Sum C1+C2+C3+C4+C5 to obtain a raw score from 0 to 20.
5. Convert to the final score:
   - If raw score is 0, output 1.
   - Otherwise output the raw score.
   - Ensure the final output is an integer in [1, 20].
6. Output ONLY the final integer score in the Evaluation Form.

Sub-score Definitions (0-4):

C1. Independent Information Units:
0 = no meaningful independent information units
1 = one weak or marginal information unit
2 = two to three distinct information units
3 = four to five clear information units
4 = six or more clearly distinguishable information units

C2. Non-redundancy:
0 = information is largely repetitive or duplicated
1 = heavy redundancy across units
2 = some redundancy present
3 = minimal redundancy
4 = each unit contributes new, non-overlapping information

C3. Granularity Appropriateness:
0 = information is severely over-fragmented or overly compressed
1 = granularity is clearly inappropriate
2 = generally reasonable granularity
3 = well-balanced and clear granularity
4 = naturally segmented at an appropriate level of detail

C4. Breadth of Contribution:
0 = information focuses on a single narrow detail
1 = extremely limited breadth
2 = covers two distinct aspects
3 = covers multiple distinct aspects
4 = covers a broad range of independent aspects relevant to the answer

C5. Substantive Density:
0 = content is mostly filler, transitions, or emphasis
1 = very low proportion of substantive information
2 = moderate substantive density
3 = high substantive density
4 = nearly all cited content is substantive information

Exclusions (Important):
- Do NOT increase Subjective Count based on text length or word count.
- Do NOT increase Subjective Count based on repetition or emphasis.
- Do NOT increase Subjective Count based on citation prominence or position.
- Do NOT increase Subjective Count based on novelty or uniqueness.
- Do NOT increase Subjective Count based on importance or impact of the source.
