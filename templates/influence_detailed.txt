Evaluation Criteria:

Influence (1-20) - the degree to which the information attributed to Source [1] materially strengthens the answer’s core conclusion, credibility, or decision confidence.
Influence is assessed via a counterfactual test: whether removing Source [1]'s attributed content would noticeably weaken the answer’s conclusion.

Scoring Method (1-20):

Compute the final Influence score as the sum of five sub-scores (each 0-4), then output a single integer from 1 to 20.

Sub-scores (0-4 each):
I1. Conclusion Dependency
I2. Evidential Support Strength
I3. Persuasive Gain
I4. Non-substitutability
I5. Contribution to Conclusion Stability

Anchor Bands (for calibration only):
1-3   : negligible influence; removal causes almost no change
4-7   : weak influence; minor supporting role
8-11  : moderate influence; strengthens but not critical
12-15 : strong influence; conclusion relies on it
16-18 : very strong influence; conclusion heavily depends on it
19-20 : decisive influence; removal would seriously undermine the conclusion

Important Output Rule:
- Output ONLY ONE integer between 1 and 20 as the final Influence score.
- Do NOT output sub-scores, explanations, or any extra text.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the query and the generated answer to identify the main conclusion(s).
2. Identify the specific content in the answer that is attributed to Source [1].
3. Perform a counterfactual check by mentally removing Source [1]'s attributed content.
4. Evaluate how much weaker the answer’s conclusion becomes after removal.
5. Assign five sub-scores (I1–I5), each from 0 to 4, based on the definitions below:
   - 0: none / fails completely
   - 1: weak
   - 2: moderate
   - 3: strong
   - 4: exceptional
6. Sum I1+I2+I3+I4+I5 to obtain a raw score from 0 to 20.
7. Convert to the final score:
   - If raw score is 0, output 1.
   - Otherwise output the raw score.
   - Ensure the final output is an integer in [1, 20].
8. Output ONLY the final integer score in the Evaluation Form.

Sub-score Definitions (0-4):

I1. Conclusion Dependency:
0 = conclusion does not depend on Source [1]
1 = weak dependency
2 = partial dependency
3 = strong dependency
4 = critical dependency; removal significantly weakens the conclusion

I2. Evidential Support Strength:
0 = provides no evidence
1 = background context only
2 = auxiliary evidence
3 = primary supporting evidence
4 = decisive evidence supporting the conclusion

I3. Persuasive Gain:
0 = no noticeable change in persuasiveness
1 = slight improvement
2 = moderate improvement
3 = significant improvement
4 = major improvement that alters confidence or judgment

I4. Non-substitutability:
0 = easily replaceable without loss of strength
1 = largely replaceable
2 = partially replaceable
3 = difficult to replace equivalently
4 = nearly irreplaceable for maintaining conclusion strength

I5. Contribution to Conclusion Stability:
0 = no contribution to stability
1 = very limited contribution
2 = some stabilizing effect
3 = clearly enhances stability
4 = substantially stabilizes and anchors the conclusion

Exclusions (Important):
- Do NOT score Influence based on source authority or reputation.
- Do NOT score Influence based on relevance alone.
- Do NOT score Influence based on novelty or uniqueness.
- Do NOT score Influence based on number of information units.
- Do NOT score Influence based on placement or writing style.
