Evaluation Criteria:

Follow-up Likelihood (1-20) - the degree to which the information from Source [1] naturally encourages further exploration of the topic after reading the generated answer.
Follow-up evaluates whether the content opens a meaningful and non-forced path for continued understanding, NOT whether it uses questions, calls-to-action, or promotional language.

Scoring Method (1-20):

Compute the final Follow-up score as the sum of five sub-scores (each 0-4), then output a single integer from 1 to 20.

Sub-scores (0-4 each):
F1. Cognitive Open Loop
F2. Exploration Path Clarity
F3. Perceived Value of Further Exploration
F4. Non-forced Engagement
F5. Topical Continuity

Anchor Bands (for calibration only):
1-3   : no meaningful follow-up motivation
4-7   : weak or unclear follow-up potential
8-11  : moderate follow-up opportunity, but not compelling
12-15 : clear and natural follow-up encouragement
16-18 : strong, non-forced motivation to continue exploring
19-20 : exceptionally natural and high-value follow-up pathways

Important Output Rule:
- Output ONLY ONE integer between 1 and 20 as the final Follow-up score.
- Do NOT output sub-scores, explanations, or any extra text.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the query and the generated answer carefully, focusing on whether the answer feels fully closed or naturally invites deeper understanding.
2. Read the sentences attributed to Source [1] and assess whether they open a meaningful next step for exploration related to the same topic.
3. Assign five sub-scores (F1–F5), each from 0 to 4, based on the definitions below:
   - 0: none / fails completely
   - 1: weak
   - 2: moderate
   - 3: strong
   - 4: exceptional
4. Sum F1+F2+F3+F4+F5 to obtain a raw score from 0 to 20.
5. Convert to the final score:
   - If raw score is 0, output 1.
   - Otherwise output the raw score.
   - Ensure the final output is an integer in [1, 20].
6. Output ONLY the final integer score in the Evaluation Form.

Sub-score Definitions (0-4):

F1. Cognitive Open Loop:
0 = the content fully closes the topic with no room for further inquiry
1 = leaves a slight but unclear gap
2 = leaves some identifiable but weak open questions
3 = clearly leaves meaningful aspects unexplored
4 = strongly but naturally leaves important aspects open for deeper understanding (not teasing)

F2. Exploration Path Clarity:
0 = no clear direction for further exploration
1 = direction is extremely vague
2 = a possible direction can be inferred
3 = a clear and reasonable direction for further exploration is implied
4 = multiple or very clear natural directions for deeper exploration are suggested

F3. Perceived Value of Further Exploration:
0 = further exploration would add little value
1 = limited additional value
2 = some additional value is likely
3 = clear additional value from deeper exploration
4 = high expected value from continued exploration of the topic

F4. Non-forced Engagement:
0 = relies heavily on calls-to-action, questions, or promotional prompts
1 = noticeable forced or manipulative engagement signals
2 = mostly natural but with slight artificial prompting
3 = natural engagement without overt prompting
4 = fully intrinsic engagement driven by informational curiosity

F5. Topical Continuity:
0 = further exploration would significantly drift from the current topic
1 = weak topical continuity
2 = partial topical continuity
3 = strong topical continuity
4 = seamless continuation along the same logical and thematic line

Exclusions (Important):
- Do NOT increase Follow-up based on the presence of question marks.
- Do NOT increase Follow-up based on calls-to-action or promotional language.
- Do NOT increase Follow-up based on importance, authority, or impact of the source.
- Do NOT increase Follow-up based on novelty or uniqueness alone.
- Do NOT increase Follow-up based on information volume or citation prominence.
